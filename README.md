# Quicksort

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm.
The time complexity is O(nlogn) in average case, and O(n2) in worst case scenario. This depends on the pivot chosen.

### How to use

Open `SpecRunner.html` in the browser. This will run all the tests.

In the browser console, create a new instance of sort: `let sort = new Sort()`.  
Run the function `quicksort` with an array input of your choice, like so:  
`sort.quicksort([1,3,5,2,7])`.


This is part of my algorithms project to validate my understanding of algorithmic complexity, and coding while learning the topics.
